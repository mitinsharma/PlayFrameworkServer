## TEST YOUR CODE
Source control is great for working with groups, but if we don't cooperate, it can make things a lot harder.  Before anything gets committed to the master branch and pushed to our origin, it MUST, at minimum, compile.  If you can't get it to run after doing `activator run` and navigating to `localhost:9000`, then either don't push what you have, or make it a branch.  This is especially important for anything in the `routes` file or `DbInit`.
